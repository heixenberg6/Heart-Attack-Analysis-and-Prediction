# Heart-Attack-Analysis-and-Prediction  
HEART ATTACK PREDICTION AND ANALYSIS | 2023  
Data Science | Machine Learning  
•Conducted an end-to-end data science project to predict the likelihood of
heart attacks  
•Utilized exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature scaling, and machine
learning algorithms to build a predictive model  
•Implemented logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machine, and
random forest algorithms to make predictions  
•Improved model accuracy using cross-validation and hyperparameter
